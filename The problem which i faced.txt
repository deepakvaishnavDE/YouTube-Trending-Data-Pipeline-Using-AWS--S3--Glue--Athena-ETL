Problem I Faced:
Athena Query Failed Because of Mixed Data Formats in S3 Folder

So, what’s happening is:
I was trying to run a query in Athena on my cleaned YouTube dataset, right? My Glue table is set up to expect 
only Parquet files in that specific S3 folder. But when I ran the query, it threw a strange error saying something 
like, “HIVE_BAD_DATA: Not valid Parquet file... expected magic number: PAR1 got: ue.”
After looking into it, I realized Athena is trying to read everything in that S3 path as Parquet, but somehow, 
there’s actually a CSV file in there. Parquet files start with a special header (PAR1), but since CSV files don’t have that, 
Athena gets confused and throws this error.
Basically, even if there’s just one CSV file in the folder, the whole query fails because it expects every file to be Parquet.

How I fixed it:
I went into my S3 bucket, found the CSV file in the folder where only Parquet files were supposed to be, 
and either deleted it or moved it somewhere else.
Once only the correct Parquet files were left, I ran my Athena query again—and it worked perfectly!

So, the main thing is:
If your Glue table is set up for Parquet, make sure there are no CSV (or any other format) files mixed in that folder. 
Otherwise, Athena will not be happy!
